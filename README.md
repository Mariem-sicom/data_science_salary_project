# data_science_salary_project

Data science positions are different across the countries and thatâ€™s generally reflected in salary, therefore we will try to predict the salary of a data scientist based on the job title, info about the company and geography. 
The result of this project is gonna be a product where you plug in that information and you get a range of salaries which will help you if you are trying to negotiate once you apply for a data science job.

## 1. Collecting data:
To collect data we will work on web scraping using Selenium, a Python library and tool used for automating web browsers. 
Once our data is in a dataframe we will load it in a csv file.
